# README

This app is a basic sample Twitter app. It does use a good example of a self-referential table with a many-to-many relationship. No scaffolding was used. Models were generated, then a migration was created for an intermediary table (FollowerToFollowing). Sample data is being seeded to generate an output of all users, their follower counts, and who they are following.
